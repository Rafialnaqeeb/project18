<p>The Last Kingdom follows the story of Uhtred, an English boy whose kingdom is conquered by the Danes and his family murdered. Earl Ragnar, a well-respected Danish warrior, then takes Uhtred as his ward, eventually adopting him. While living a Danish lifestyle from that moment on with his adopted family, Uhtred's loyalties are brought into question when his treacherous uncle attacks his new family, and King Alfred of Wessex decides that Uhtred may come in handy if brought into his service.

Based on true events that lead to the formation of England, this series draws on many historical milestones to make for some compelling storytelling, however not every aspect of the series is historically accurate. Let's take a look at some important aspects of this series that may surprise you with regards to their authenticity.
